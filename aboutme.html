<div id="aboutme">
I like to explore new technologies, investigate the internals of technologies and their implications in the society.
In addition to that, i believe in breaking and building - like to dirty my hands by writing codes. In my day job, i work
for Ericsson Research. However, the ideas and thoughts presented in this blog is personal. Some of the blog posts may 
be short sighted, please let me know if your thoughts differ with my ideas.
