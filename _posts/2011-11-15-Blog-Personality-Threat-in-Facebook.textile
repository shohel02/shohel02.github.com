<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a long time, I was
planning to write a blog related to  personality threat of online
social networking sites. Most of the social networking sites, for
example, Twitter, Google+, or Facebook, especially the latter one,
 is now ingrained to our life. So, our personality is largely
defined by the way we portray ourselves in these media.</P>

In June 2011, I got a friend post on my FB wall  Sexy Marika
Fruscioâ€œ , an Italian actress, who apparently has problem to place
his clothes. Naively, I clicked on the link which ,in turn, posts the
message to all of my FB friends.</P>

</P>

<p style="clear:both;">
The is continues for a while and I got several other repeated posts in my FB wall.  The
nature of such  attack is that, it apparently fools me between the
intension and actions related to my FB wall. After that four months
have passed and these type of attack is still continuing even though
FB is employing different techniques to enhance security of the site.
Even in last night, I got a spam message in my FB message box from
one of my friends.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Techniques to achieve:</B></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Click jacking is a
method to perform unexpected actions by clicking on a concealed link.
It uses HTML /CSS tricks to load a page over another page.  This
mean, the web page viewer performs an actions, and it turns out to be
a different action. For example, in the following picture, you are
browsing a web page which is asking to solve this Captcha.

<p style="clear:both;">
While, in reality, it
disguises FB comment interface and as soon as the user clicks the
submit button it post the message to your wall.

</P>

<p style="clear:both;">
<B>Like jacking:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like-jacking is similar
to click-jacking in which users are forced to Like a clip to watch
it. Naive users clicks the like button to watch the videos. The
following is a classic example to trap you under Like jacking attack.
 Normally, you see a FB wall post from a friend which lures you to
click the link to watch it.</P>

</p>
<p style="clear:both;">
Naive users also click the Like button to watch the videos.  
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="/images/post_15_nov/Personality_Threat%20_html_m36343d9f.png" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=538 HEIGHT=364 BORDER=0><BR>
</P>

<p style="clear:both;">
This attack can also be
performed from a web page which has a FB Like button. Some previous
Like attacks changes the 'Like button' to become transparent and
linked with the mouse pointer. This allows the attacker to disguise
FB like button activity while the user plays the clip. 
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Malicious script
scam: </B>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This another common way
of spamming using your FB account. In malicious script scam, the
attacker lures the user with some lucrative offer and a link to get
the offer. When you copy / paste  the link in your browser, you allow
the malicious script to take control of your FB account.  The script
can do anything from sending message, writing on your or your friends
wall and so on.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Malicious apps in
Facebook: </B>
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">People love playing
with apps, such as  Farmvile, Zynga, and so on, in Facebook.  Over
the years, a huge number of third party apps has been accumulated
within FB which did not follow the security and privacy standards.
This loophole is exploited by the spammers to gain access to access
to your personal information through FB apps.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Prevention
techniques:</B></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Facebook, as a service
provider, is constantly improving their security features. However,
this does not mean that attacks against your personality is solved.
In fact, we will continue to see more similar  and new attacks
against social networking sites. However, as attackers continue to
employ new methods to exploit online social networking features, you
can effectively reduce personality related threats through safe
practices:</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a) Use common sense. if
something looks suspicious and weird, do not click on the link within
or outside FB.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b) If you do want to
click on the link, start private browsing from your web browser.
Almost, all web browsers supports private browsing. ( Be cautions,
not to be logged in the FB when you are clicking a malicious link
during private browsing session.).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c) Update web browser
regularly to mitigate browser vulnerabilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">d) Send abuse report to
Facebook if you are victim of some these attack.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In next posts, I will
write about the technical and social aspect of personality threat in
Facebook.</P>
